A terminal based application to process and plot data on Calgary High Schools (Data from 2019 -2021 inclusive) read in from CSV files.

## Date Completed: 
November 2021

## Description
This project is a combination of many tecniques leanred in this Python class. The main function of the project is to read in the csv files containing data on Calgary High Schools from 2019 - 2021, prints all the data read in from the CSV files, and then asks the user to type in a school code/ school name and displays 2 graphs and prints some informatoin to the terminal about enrollment stats for that school in the years 2019 - 2021. 

The graphs were created using `Matplotlib`, the CSV file data was read using `Numpy`,  and the `Math` module was used for some calculations.

The program also uses object-oriented-programming to create a School object for the requested school and uses the object's method to print the terminal statistics. 

## Running the Program
Enusre you have the three mentioned Python libraries mentioned above (`Matplotlib`, `Numpy`, and `Math`) then run the file on the terminal of your choice.
